_Centrality_ is a term to describe importance of individual nodes in a graph.
There has been a lot of research carried out in this topic for network analysis
to answer the question,
"Which are the most important nodes (vertices) in a graph?"
Here is the list of different metrics to find it, which I would like to discuss:

* [Degree Centrality](#degree-centrality)
* [Eigenvector Centrality](#eigenvector-centrality)
* [Katz Centrality](#katz-centrality)
* [PageRank](#pagerank)
* [HITS Hubs and Authorities](#hits-hubs-and-authorities)
* [Closeness Centrality](#closeness-centrality)
* [Betweenness Centrality](#betweenness-centrality)


I will be using [NetworkX Python](https://networkx.github.io/) (2.4) library
along with [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (3.2.2). (Updated on
01.06.2020)

{% highlight python %}
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.colors as mcolors

# for Notebook
%matplotlib inline
{% endhighlight %}

First, we are defining a simple method to draw the graph and the centrality
metrics of nodes with a heat map.

<!-- **In [2]:** -->

{% highlight python %}
def draw(G, pos, measures, measure_name):
    
    nodes = nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos, node_size=250, cmap=plt.cm.plasma, 
                                   node_color=list(measures.values()),
                                   nodelist=measures.keys())
    nodes.set_norm(mcolors.SymLogNorm(linthresh=0.01, linscale=1, base=10))
    # labels = nx.draw_networkx_labels(G, pos)
    edges = nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos)

    plt.title(measure_name)
    plt.colorbar(nodes)
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.show()
{% endhighlight %}

Zacharyâ€™s Karate Club graph is defined as the example graph `G`.
It is basically a social network of members of an university karate club,
where undirected edges connects people who interact outside the club.

<!-- **In [3]:** -->

{% highlight python %}
G = nx.karate_club_graph()
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=675)
{% endhighlight %}

We also need a directed graph to demonstrate some other centrality measures.
Here we are defining the toy directed graph `DiG` which is given as an example
in [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank#/media/File:PageRanks-
Example.svg).

<!-- **In [4]:** -->

{% highlight python %}
DiG = nx.DiGraph()
DiG.add_edges_from([(2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 4),
                    (5, 6), (6, 2), (6, 5), (7, 2), (7, 5), (8, 2),
                    (8, 5), (9, 2), (9, 5), (10, 5), (11, 5)])
dpos = {1: [0.1, 0.9], 2: [0.4, 0.8], 3: [0.8, 0.9], 4: [0.15, 0.55],
        5: [0.5,  0.5], 6: [0.8,  0.5], 7: [0.22, 0.3], 8: [0.30, 0.27],
        9: [0.38, 0.24], 10: [0.7,  0.3], 11: [0.75, 0.35]}
{% endhighlight %}

## Degree Centrality

<!-- **In [5]:** -->

{% highlight python %}
draw(G, pos, nx.degree_centrality(G), 'Degree Centrality')
{% endhighlight %}

_Degree_ of a node is basically number of edges that it has.
The basic intuition is that, nodes with more connections are
more influential and important in a network.
In other words, the person with higher friend count in a social network,
the more cited paper (_in-degree_) in a scientific citation network
is the one that is more central according to this metric.

For directed graphs, _in-degree_, number of incoming points, is considered as
importance factor for nodes.

<!-- **In [6]:** -->

{% highlight python %}
draw(DiG, dpos, nx.in_degree_centrality(DiG), 'DiGraph Degree Centrality')
{% endhighlight %}


![png](/images/2017-07-17-network-centrality-measures-and-their-visualization_files/11_0.png)


## Eigenvector Centrality

<!-- **In [7]:** -->

{% highlight python %}
draw(G, pos, nx.eigenvector_centrality(G), 'Eigenvector Centrality')
{% endhighlight %}


![png](/images/2017-07-17-network-centrality-measures-and-their-visualization_files/13_0.png)


_Eigenvector centrality_ is a basic extension of _degree centrality_,
which defines centrality of a node as proportional to its neighbors' importance.
When we sum up all connections of a node, not all neighbors are equally
important.
Let's consider two nodes in a friend network with same degree,
the one who is connected to more central nodes should be more central.

First, we define an initial guess for the centrality of nodes in a graph as
$$x_i=1$$.
Now we are going to iterate for the new centrality value $$x_i'$$ for node $$i$$ as
following:

$$
  x_i' = \sum_{j} A_{ij}x_j
$$

Here $$ A_{ij} $$ is an element of _the adjacency matrix_,
where it gives $$ 1 $$ or $$ 0 $$ for whether an edge exists between nodes $$ i $$ and
$$ j $$.
it can also be written in matrix notation as $$ \mathbf{x'} = \mathbf{Ax} $$.
We iterate over t steps to find the vector $$ \mathbf{x}(t) $$ as:

$$
  \mathbf{x}(t) = \mathbf{A^t x}(0)
$$

The drawing also shows, the nodes which have the same number of connections are
not necessarily in the same heat map color.
The one that is connected to more central nodes are more _hot_ in this
visualization.

However, as we can see from the definition,
it is a problematic measure for directed graphs.
Let's say that a new research paper is published and it references a handful of
existing papers.
It would not contribute to any of those referenced papers in this citation
network
because it is not cited by any other papers and has zero _eigenvector
centrality_.
In other words, _eigenvector centrality_ would not take zero _in-degree_ nodes
into account
in directed graphs such as citation networks.

<!-- **In [8]:** -->

{% highlight python %}
draw(DiG, dpos, nx.eigenvector_centrality_numpy(DiG), 'DiGraph Eigenvector Centrality')
{% endhighlight %}


![png](/images/2017-07-17-network-centrality-measures-and-their-visualization_files/15_0.png)


Here the contribution from zero _in-degree_ nodes is zero; consequently, all
values are zero except two nodes which are referencing each other.

## Katz Centrality

<!-- **In [9]:** -->

{% highlight python %}
draw(DiG, dpos, nx.katz_centrality(DiG, alpha=0.1, beta=1.0), 'DiGraph Katz Centrality')
{% endhighlight %}


![png](/images/2017-07-17-network-centrality-measures-and-their-visualization_files/18_0.png)


_Katz centrality_ introduces two positive constants $$ \alpha $$ and $$ \beta $$
to tackle the problem of _eigenvector centrality_ with zero in-degree nodes:

$$
    x_i = \alpha \sum_{j} A_{ij} x_j + \beta,
$$

again $$ A_{ij} $$ is an element of _the adjacency matrix_,
and it can also be written in matrix notation as $$ \mathbf{x} = \alpha
\mathbf{Ax} + \beta \mathbf{1} $$.
This $$ \beta $$ constant gives a _free_ centrality contribution for all nodes
even though they don't get any contribution from other nodes.
The existence of a node alone would provide it some importance.
$$ \alpha $$ constant determines the balances between the contribution from other
nodes and the _free_ constant.

Although this method is introduced as a solution for directed graphs,
it can be useful for some applications of undirected graphs as well.

{% highlight python %}
draw(G, pos, nx.katz_centrality(G, alpha=0.1, beta=1.0), 'Katz Centrality')
{% endhighlight %}


![png](/images/2017-07-17-network-centrality-measures-and-their-visualization_files/20_0.png)


## PageRank

<!-- **In [11]:** -->

{% highlight python %}
draw(DiG, dpos, nx.pagerank(DiG, alpha=0.85), 'DiGraph PageRank')
{% endhighlight %}


![png](/images/2017-07-17-network-centrality-measures-and-their-visualization_files/22_0.png)


PageRank was introduced by the founders of Google to rank websites in search
results.
It can be considered as an extension of _Katz centrality_.
The websites on the web can be modeled as a directed graph,
where hypermedia links between websites determines the edges.
Let's consider a popular web directory website with high _Katz centrality_ value
which has millions of links to other websites.
It would contribute to every single website significantly, nevertheless not all
of them are important.
To overcome that issue, contribution value is divided by _out-degree_ of the
node:

$$
    x_i = \alpha \sum_{j} A_{ij} \frac{x_j}{k_j^{out}} + \beta,
$$

where $$ k_j^{out} = 1 $$ for zero out-degree nodes to avoid division by zero.
It can also be written in matrix terms as:

$$
    \mathbf{x} = \alpha \mathbf{A D^{-1} x} + \beta \mathbf{1},
$$

where $$  \mathbf{D} $$ is a diagonal matrix with elements $$ D_{ii} =
max(k_i^{out}, 1) $$.

As the drawing demonstrates, the nodes with fewer _out-degree_ contributes way
more to each node compared the _Katz Centrality_. Here the node at the top right
gets only reference of a very important node, and it becomes way more important
compared to the _Katz Centrality_; on the other hand, the node in the center
which gets contribution from high _out-degree_ nodes loses its importance.

## HITS Hubs and Authorities

<!-- **In [12]:** -->

{% highlight python %}
h,a = nx.hits(DiG)
draw(DiG, dpos, h, 'DiGraph HITS Hubs')
draw(DiG, dpos, a, 'DiGraph HITS Authorities')
{% endhighlight %}


![png](/images/2017-07-17-network-centrality-measures-and-their-visualization_files/25_0.png)

Up until this point, we have discussed the measures that captures high node
centrality, however, there can be nodes in the network which are important for
the network, but they are not central. In particular, let's consider a survey
(review) article in a scientific citation network. The article itself is not
necessarily stating a new discovery and it is not central; but nevertheless it
is a helpful material to acquire knowledge on a topic because it captures a lot
of central research articles. In order to find out such nodes, HITS algorithm
introduces two types of central nodes: _Hubs_ and _Authorities_. _Authorities_
are the one that most cited by _Hubs_ and _Hubs_ are the one that citing the
most high _Authority_ nodes.

_Authority Centrality_ is defined as the sum of the hub centralities which point
to the node $$i$$:

$$
    x_i = \alpha \sum_{j} A_{ij} y_j,
$$

where $$\alpha$$ is constant. Likewise, _Hub Centrality_ is the sum of the
authorities which are pointed by the node $$i$$:

$$
    y_i = \beta \sum_{j} A_{ji} x_j,
$$

with constant $$\beta$$. Here notice that the element of the adjacency matrix are
swapped for _Hub Centrality_ because we are concerned with outgoing edges for
hubs. So in matrix notation:

$$
    \mathbf{x} = \alpha \mathbf{Ay}, \quad
    \mathbf{y} = \beta \mathbf{A^Tx}.
$$

As it can be seen from the drawing, HITS Algorithm also tackles the problem with
zero _in-degree_ nodes of _Eigenvector Centrality_. These zero _in-degree_ nodes
become central hubs and contribute to other nodes. Yet we can still use a _free_
centrality contribution constant like in _Katz Centrality_ or other variants.

## Closeness Centrality

<!-- **In [13]:** -->

{% highlight python %}
draw(G, pos, nx.closeness_centrality(G), 'Closeness Centrality')
{% endhighlight %}


![png](/images/2017-07-17-network-centrality-measures-and-their-visualization_files/28_0.png)


 _Closeness Centrality_ is a self-explanatory measure where each node's
importance is determined by closeness to all other nodes. Let $$d_{ij}$$ be the
length of the shortest path between nodes $$i$$ and $$j$$, the average distance
$$l_i$$ is such as:

$$
  l_i = \dfrac{1}{n} \sum_{j}d_{ij}
$$

Since we are looking for the closer node, the _Closeness Centrality_ $$C_i$$ is
inverse proportional to average length $$l_i$$, so:

$$
  C_i = \dfrac{1}{l_i} = \dfrac{n}{\sum_{j}d_{ij}}
$$

Here we are using an _unweighted_ graph and all edges have weight $$1$$ distance
cost for calculating shortest path length $$d_{ij}$$. This measure can be used to
determine the central distribution point in a delivery network.

## Betweenness Centrality

<!-- **In [14]:** -->

{% highlight python %}
draw(G, pos, nx.betweenness_centrality(G), 'Betweenness Centrality')
{% endhighlight %}


![png](/images/2017-07-17-network-centrality-measures-and-their-visualization_files/31_0.png)


_Betweenness Centrality_ is another centrality that is based on shortest path
between nodes. It is determined as number of the shortest paths passing by the
given node. For starting node $$s$$, destination node $$t$$ and the input node $$i$$
that holds $$s \ne t \ne i$$, let $$n_{st}^i$$ be 1 if node $$i$$ lies on the shortest
path between $$s$$ and $$t$$; and $$0$$ if not. So the _betweenness centrality_ is
defined as:

$$
  x_i = \sum_{st} n_{st}^i
$$

However, there can be more than one shortest path between $$s$$ and $$t$$ and that
will count for centrality measure more than once. Thus, we need to divide the
contribution to $$g_{st}$$, total number of shortest paths between $$s$$ and $$t$$.

$$
  x_i = \sum_{st} \frac{n_{st}^i}{g_{st}}
$$
