## Good Shape ![Good Shape](/images/gestalt/1-good-shape.png)

* Perception has tendency towards remembering things as “good” /
clear / simple shapes
* “Cognitive compression algorithm”!
* Easier shape easier to remember

## Proximity ![Proximity](/images/gestalt/2-proximity.png)

* Spatially (or temporally!) close objects (events) are perceived as
belonging together.
* Advantage: allows for order by position only, without other aides
* Helps to keep the interface simple

## Closure ![Closure](/images/gestalt/3-closure.png)

* Closed shapes appear as
belonging together
  * Temporally?
* Foundation of window metaphor
* But: Don’t overdo it

## Similarity ![Similarity](/images/gestalt/4-similarity.png)

* Similar shapes appear as belonging together
  * Temporally?
* Different objects have higher information content (i.e., cognitive effort)
  * This can be a good thing or a bad thing
* Similar is not necessarily constant
  * Linearity, “elegant curve”,...


## Continuity ![Continuity](/images/gestalt/5-continuity.png)

* A.k.a. “Law of the Good Curve”
* Continuous shapes appear as belonging together
  * Temporally?
* Example: music

## Experience ![Experience](/images/gestalt/6-experience.png)

* We tend to “file” new things into categories we already know
* Uses existing knowledge, thereby saving learning effort and memory
* Foundation for the success of metaphors in UI design
  * Analog to real-world models
  * E.g., desktop metaphor

## Common Fate

<object data="/images/gestalt/7-common-fate.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

* A.k.a. “Law of Common Movement”
* Animated objects within a static environment appear as a group
* By-Law: Animation has a very strong effect in UI design
  * Here: Synchronous animation groups the items
